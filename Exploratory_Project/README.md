# Exploratory Theme: Airplane Crashes and Fatalities 

## 1. Propectus - Exploratory Visualization (Interactive World Map)

Main Source of Information Link to the article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/ My project idea started after reading an article on the FiveThirtyEight website "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?" It's my plan to visit as many countries as possible in my time on earth.  Surprisingly, I had never thought about airline incidents before reading this article. I found it quite interesting and, I think it might be of interesting to you as well.

## Abstract

For the exploratory theme, there are 4 different visualizations working interactively. The project consists on an interactive map and timeline controlled by the user selecting the desired airline.

## Datasources:
The datasource contains both csv and json files available.
I used excel to work with the data. Link to datasource: https://data.world/data-society/airplane-crashes/workspace/file?filename=Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv
