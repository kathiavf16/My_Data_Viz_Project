My project will be based on the FiveThirtyEight article "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?". I chose this article because I love traveling and this is a question I had never thought about before. I consider it is interesting, and I think this might get the attention of other traveler also. 

#### Datasource:
The datasource contains both csv and json files available.<br>
I plan to use excel to view and clean my data because it is an small dataset.

This dataset have a total of 8 variables and I tthink that will be enough information to create my visualizations. I thinking about putting a dashboard together with different visualizations showing the important facts that the article points out about airline crashes. I'm thinking about using a map to display the airline headquaters, but is not set in stone yet. More about my 
design plan coming soon...
