# Exploratory Visualization 1: Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?

#### Main Source of Information
#### Link to article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/

My project will be based on the FiveThirtyEight article "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?" I chose this article because I love traveling, and this is a question I had never thought about before reading this article. I believe it is quite interesting and it might get the attention of other travelers as well. 

#### Datasource:
The datasource contains both csv and json files available.<br>
I plan to use excel to view and clean my data because it is an small dataset.

This dataset has a total of 8 variables. I think I have enough information to create my visualizations. I would like to make a dashboard with different visualizations showing the important facts about the airline crashes. Also, I'm thinking about including a map to display the airline headquarters globally. To build the map, I would need to get the latitude and longitude from another source. However,  I'm not very confident about using the map at this point. More about my design plan coming soon...
