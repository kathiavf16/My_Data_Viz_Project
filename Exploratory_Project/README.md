My project idea popped after reading an article on the FiveThirtyEight website "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?" It's on my agenda to visit as many countries as I can in my lifetime. I had never thought about airline incidents before reading this article. I found it quite interesting and, I think it might be of your interest as well.

## Abstract

For the exploratory theme, there are 4 different visualizations working interactively. The project consists on an interactive map and timeline controlled by the user selecting the desired airline.

## Datasources:
The datasource contains both csv and json files available.
I used excel to work with the data. Link to datasource: https://data.world/data-society/airplane-crashes/workspace/file?filename=Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv

This dataset has a total of 8 variables.
