# Narrative Theme - Important Facts About Airplane Crashes 

## 1 - Propectus

My narrative visualization will be a continuation of the "Airline Crashes and Fatalities" going into more detail. In this one, I would address commercial and non-commercial flights. I will create graphs explaining the differences of both to enable the readers to make comparisons. I will be using the same dataset since it contains all the information I need.

## 2 - Abstract
  This narrative is a follow up of the exploratory theme introducing important facts you should know about airline crashes. The narrative is broken down into 4 sections: Top 60 locations with accident occurrences, top 20 plane operators involved in accidents, fatalities over time - 1972 the deadliest year, and causes of fatal accidents by decade.
  
## 3 - Datasource: 

I use the same dataset from the exploratory project
