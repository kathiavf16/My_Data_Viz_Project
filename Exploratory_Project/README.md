My project idea popped after reading an article on the FiveThirtyEight website "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?" It's on my agenda to visit as many countries as I can in my lifetime. I had never thought about airline incidents before reading this article. I found it quite interesting and, I think it might be of your interest as well.

## Abstract

For the exploratory theme, I drew 4 different visualizations and made them work together interactively. The project consists on an interactive map and timeline controlled by the user selection from the airlineâ€™s table. When clicking on the desired airline the incident location updates , and the user can start exploring. On the map when selecting one incident, a summary of that specific crash appears enabling the user to learn more about it.

     
## Datasources:
The datasource contains both csv and json files available.
I used excel to work witht the data. Link to datasource: https://data.world/data-society/airplane-crashes/workspace/file?filename=Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv

This dataset has a total of 8 variables.
